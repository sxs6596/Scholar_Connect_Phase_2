            Scholar Connect was conceptualized to address the growing need for a centralized repository of academic research. The platform was designed to streamline
            the management of academic theses, including submission, review, and collaboration tools, all within a structured and easy-to-use interface.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-4">
            Using the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram as the foundation, key entities such as Authors, Users, Thesis, Reviews, and Statistics were modeled to create 
            an efficient database design. Each thesis is associated with authors, reviewers, and submission statistics, ensuring comprehensive management and tracking 
            of research work across the platform.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-4">
            The development team collaborated to create both front-end and back-end services. User roles such as Researcher, Reviewer, Content Manager, and Admin 
            were clearly defined, ensuring appropriate access and functionality for each user. The back-end was built with a robust API and relational database, 
            while the front-end provides a seamless user experience with interactive features such as grant applications, event management, and collaboration tools.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-4">
            Scholar Connect continues to evolve, integrating advanced features such as real-time collaboration and detailed user analytics to further enhance the 
            academic research experience. The project is a testament to the team's dedication to promoting academic collaboration and innovation.
